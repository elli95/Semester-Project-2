<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is my second semester project assignment at Noroff
In this assignment, I create an auction page for the sale and purchase of goods.
In my case, I originally thought of a target group consisting of individuals who want to buy/sell garden tools or farm equipment for both plants and animals.
But as time went by with uncertainty about the design, I changed my target group to the general public who might want to sell/sell at auction.
But, still with the lush and green part of my earlier idea.
I feel that the opportunity to reach the original target audience is still there, the design just needs something a little more, which I have not have time for in this case.
Having said that, I feel that this is suitable for a general target group that wants slightly quieter surroundings.

My design is based on my prototype made in figma for this assignment:
