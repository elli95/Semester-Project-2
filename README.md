<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is my second semester project assignment at Noroff
In this assignment, I create an auction page for the sale and purchase of goods.
In my case, I have envisioned a target group consisting of individuals who want to buy/sell gardening tools or farm equipment for both plants and animals.
My design is based on my prototype made in figma for this assignment:

- [Mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/WZxW9EUB7GwtmR7fsUHvur/Mobile?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=x2Jv5MhWCmp5P1Jt-1)
- [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/WZxW9EUB7GwtmR7fsUHvur/Mobile?type=design&node-id=18%3A131&mode=design&t=x2Jv5MhWCmp5P1Jt-1)

To see the development tasks and where in the project I am, please refer to my [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/elli95/projects/1/views/1) page Or look to my [Gantt chart](https://github.com/users/elli95/projects/1/views/2) for a different perspective.
